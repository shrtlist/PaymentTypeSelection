// Your task is to finish this application to satisfy requirements below and make it look like on the attached screenshots. Try to use 80/20 principle.
// Good luck! üçÄ

// 1. Setup UI of the ContentView. Try to keep it as similar as possible.
// 2. Subscribe to the timer and count seconds down from 60 to 0 on the ContentView.
// 3. Present PaymentModalView as a sheet after tapping on the "Open payment" button.
// 4. Load payment types from repository in PaymentInfoView. Show loader when waiting for the response. No need to handle error.
// 5. List should be refreshable.
// 6. Show search bar for the list to filter payment types. You can filter items in any way.
// 7. User should select one of the types on the list. Show checkmark next to the name when item is selected.
// 8. Show "Done" button in navigation bar only if payment type is selected. Tapping this button should hide the modal.
// 9. Show "Finish" button on ContentScreen only when "payment type" was selected.
// 10. Replace main view with "FinishView" when user taps on the "Finish" button.
