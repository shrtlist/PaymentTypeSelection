## Setup

### Open the project in Xcode

```bash
open SwiftUIChallenge.xcodeproj
```

### Running the Project

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select your target device (iOS Simulator or physical device)
3. Click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press `Cmd + R` to build and run the project

### Project Structure
The application's entry point is `SwiftUIChallengeApp.swift`, which loads the main `ContentView`. The core functionality is organized as follows:
- `SwiftUIChallengeApp.swift`: Application entry point and setup
- `ContentView.swift`: Main view implementation
- `PaymentTypesRepositoryImplementation.swift`: Data layer implementation
